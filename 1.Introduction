Features:   1.General Purpose: We can use anywhere i.e in most of technology.
            2.Procedural Oriented Programming: Python is inherited from C language.
            3.Object oriented Programming: Python is inherited from C++ language. i.e Python is support features of both pop and oop.
            4.Scripting language: Python is inherited from shell and perl,so it support scripting features also.
            5.Python is written in c language i.e. classes and library of python is written in c language.
            6.Interpreted Programming: Python is compile and run at same time i.e it check line by line code and run at same time.
            7.High level programming language: Easy to understand to user. (Low level means language which is easy to understand for machine.)
            8.Free for work: It is avaible on websites for free.
            9.Open source: It is available for customize according to our need.
            10.Dynamic Type or Typeless: We dont have to define datatype. i.e. in java "int c=20;" but in python "c=20"
            
Standard/Flavour:1.Cpython    (Use c language)
                 2.Jpython    (Use java language)  
                 3.Ironpython (C# or .net is use) 
                 4.Anaconda   (Use for Bigdata)
                 5.Rubypython (Use Ruby language)
                 6.Stackless Python 
                 7.pypypython
Applications:1.Internet of things.
             2.Machine Learning (Pandas,Matplot,Six,Numpy) 
             3.Artificial Inteligence
             4.Web Design and Developement (Flask,Django,Framework)
             5.Data Science
             6.Natural language processing
             7.Neural network
             
 Disadvantage:1.Interpreted language: It take more time i.e every time it compile program.
              2.Python is not use for Android Application Developement.
