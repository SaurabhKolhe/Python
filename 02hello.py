#Simple Hello world program

print("Hello World") 
#We have to just write in print,no main function or any class is needed.So it is very easy language.

#By default print having end="\n" by this we go on new line after print
print("hello",end="\n")
#we can write this also
print("Hello",end=" ")
print("I am Saurabh",end="\t")
print("Thank You")

b=40
print(a,b,sep="+")
